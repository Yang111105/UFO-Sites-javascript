## UFO Dataset Filter

This exercise uses JavaScript code to load UFO sighting data into HTML web page. 

- "UFO-level-1" listens for events and filters the table by date only;

- "UFO-level-2" listens for events and searches through multiple columns (date/time, city, state, country, shape) to find rows that match user input.



### Instructions:
1. Clone repo to local folder
2. Open "UFO-level-2" folder from Visual Studio, open index.html file with Live Server and the UFO page will load.
3. Input criteria in the filter boxes and the table will change to filtered results.
4. Note: for "UFO-level-1" filter works with form submit or button click; for "UFO-level-2" filter works with form change
